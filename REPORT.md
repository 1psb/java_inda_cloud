# java_inda_cloud

1. Docker, Spring config, Spring Eureka - I got useful experience with these technologies while resolving different issues 

2. The hardest part of this project was resolving issues related to microservices configuration in Docker. 
I think provided information was enough, but might be it could be better if initial project contains more hints and less unobvious things.
Maybe it would be useful to have have more practical information about Docker for initial work with this project
